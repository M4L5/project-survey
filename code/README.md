Survey form with React
This is a survey made in Technigo's week 10. Created in React.


The problem
I have had a hard time understanding React and how to begin the project. I followed our teachers code for the Form.js and then tried to re do it a little bit. I also had a session with my code mentor which made things clearer regarding the form. I have made it work to get input and then  hide the form and replace with a summary. I then went on to try make a header with a profile image as a props. Unfortunetly I don't manage to make it work, but I did practise props with other elements in the header.

If I had more time: 
- I would style it properly
- Style the summary
- Made the input options as required
- Radio buttons, only one can be checked
- Make it accessible
